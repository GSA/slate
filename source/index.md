# What is i14y?

Our i14y API allows you to send content directly from your content management system (CMS) into [DigitalGov Search](http://search.digitalgov.gov/) for real-time indexing. By hooking into your CMS workflow, you can immediately [create](#create-a-document), [update](#update-a-document), and [delete](#delete-a-document) the associated documents in our search indexes via this API.

Even if you donâ€™t have a CMS, you can develop software to publish your content in a way that meets the i14y API specifications below.

Ruby/Python/Node clients are welcome.

Using i14y is optional. The rest of our service offering will continue as-is, providing the default web results from commercial indexes.

## What are the main benefits of i14y?

By a long shot, the two features we get asked for most are:

1. Immediate inclusion of new or updated content in search results.
2. Control over which documents are (or are not) in your search index.

i14y answers both of these requests.

# Authentication

You'll need to have a [DigitalGov Search account](https://search.usa.gov/sites) and at least one site already set up.

> To authorize, use this code:

```sh
# With curl, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents"
  -XPOST
  -H "Content-Type:application/json"
  -u your_drawer_handle:your_secret_token
```

> Replace `your_drawer_handle` with your drawer handle, and replace `your_secret_token` with your API key.

The i14y API uses keys to allow access to the API. While we're still in beta, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) to request access.

The i14y API expects the key to be included in all API requests to the server in a Basic authentication header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Basic qG9yZW46bG9yZW5pMTR5dG9rZW4=`

<aside class="notice">
Replace <code>your_drawer_handle</code> with your drawer handle, and replace <code>your_secret_token</code> with your API key.

# Create, update, and delete documents

## Create a document

```sh
curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents"

  -d '{"document_id":"1",
      "title":"this is a fairly short title",
      "path": "http://www.gov.gov/cms/doc1.html",
      "created": "2015-05-12T22:35:09Z",
