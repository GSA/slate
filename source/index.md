# Introduction

Welcome to the i14y Content API! You can use our API to publish your CMS documents into our indexes to power your DigitalGov Search box.

By hooking into the existing lifecycle of documents in your CMS, you can create/update/delete the associated documents in our indexes via this Content API.

Ruby/Python/Node clients are welcome.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```sh
# With curl, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents"
  -XPOST 
  -u your_collection_handle:your_secret_token 
```

> Make sure to replace `your_collection_handle` with the name you were issued, and make sure you replace `your_secret_token` with the API key you were given.

The i14y API uses keys to allow access to the API. For now, you can request access via [email](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov).

The i14y API expects the key to be included in all API requests to the server in a Basic authentication header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Basic qG9yZW46bG9yZW5pMTR5dG9rZW4=`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your_collection_handle</code> and <code>your_secret_token</code> with your personal collection handle and API key.
</aside>

# HTTPS

All access to the i14y Content API must use SSL.

# Documents
